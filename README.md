## 📖 Overview

**Relictum Launcher** is a sophisticated, open-source platform designed to modernize how you interact with legacy game clients. Built with security and modularity at its core, it serves as a central hub for managing multiple game versions, ensuring client integrity, and extending functionality through a powerful plugin ecosystem.

It sets a new standard for client management with **Advanced Integrity Verification**, ensuring your game environment remains authentic and unmodified.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔌 Advanced Plugin Engine (New)
*   **Modular Architecture**: Extend the launcher's capabilities without modifying the core.
*   **Community Extensions**: Install plugins to add new features, tools, or UI enhancements.
*   **Custom Game Support**: Plugins can register and manage additional game versions or custom projects beyond the default supported clients.
*   **Sandboxed Execution**: Third-party code runs in a secure, isolated environment.

### 🛡️ Integrity & Security
*   **Deep Code Verification**: Utilizes SHA-256 cryptographic hashing to verify the internal structure of the application (`app.asar`), going beyond simple executable checks.
*   **Real-Time Status**: A dedicated security dashboard provides instant feedback on the launcher's integrity.
*   **Active Monitoring**: Visual alerts notify you immediately of any unauthorized modifications.

### 🌍 Global Localization
*   **Multi-Language Interface**: Fully localized experience available in **English**, **Spanish**, **German**, **Portuguese**, and **Russian**.
*   **Dynamic Switching**: Instantly switch languages without restarting the application.

### 🧩 Intelligent Addon Management
*   **Unified Browser**: Discover and install addons directly from the launcher.
*   **One-Click Deployment**: Automated installation handles file placement and versioning.
*   **Smart Organization**: Automatically groups complex, multi-module addons into clean, single entries.

### ⚡ Client Management
*   **Multi-Version Support**: Native handling for **1.12.1**, **2.4.3**, and **3.3.5a** clients.
*   **Auto-Discovery**: Intelligently locates and validates existing installations on your system.

### 🎨 Modern UX
*   **Immersive Design**: A refined interface featuring glass-morphism effects and classic aesthetics.
*   **Integrated Media**: Built-in ambient music player for an immersive browsing experience.
